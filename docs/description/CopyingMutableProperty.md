Warns if “copying” semantics are specified in a @property declaration for a common mutable NSCopying class type that has an immutable superclass (for example NSMutableArray). Invoking -[NSCopying copy] for such objects will in many cases return an immutable copy. This means that after assigning a mutable object value to such a property, it may in fact get an immutable copy of the assigned value (which will lead to crashes as soon as any attempt is made to mutate this immutable object).
