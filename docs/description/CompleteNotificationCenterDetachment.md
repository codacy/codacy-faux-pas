Warns when an object removes itself as an observer to all notifications (by invoking -[NSNotificationCenter removeObserver:] with self). This can be a problem if a superclass or a subclass wants to keep observing some notifications. The recommended way to handle this is to remove self as an observer only for the specific notifications that you have previously begun observing. This rule does not warn about such removals occuring in -dealloc.
