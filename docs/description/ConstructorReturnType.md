Warns if an init or factory method return type is anything other than instancetype. Properly specifying the return type for factory methods (e.g. +[NSArray arrayWithObject:]) allows the compiler to perform more type checking, which helps catch bugs. Even though the compiler automatically determines the return types of init methods (even if they are declared as id) it is still good to be explicit and use instancetype.
