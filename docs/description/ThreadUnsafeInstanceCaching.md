Warns about variables with global storage whose type is an object pointer to a known thread-unsafe class. -[NSThread threadDictionary] can be used to cache instances of thread-unsafe classes â€” one instance for each thread. This rule does not warn about code occuring in subclasses of (or categories on) UIKit or AppKit classes, because it can be assumed that these are always accessed solely from the main thread.
