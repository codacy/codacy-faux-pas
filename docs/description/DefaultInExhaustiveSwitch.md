If a switch statement explicitly handles all possible values, then the default case is unnecessary dead code, and might even be misleading to people reading the code. If the intended purpose of the default case is to safeguard against enum fields that are added in the future but accidentally left unhandled in the switch, the compiler warning -Wswitch-enum is recommended for that purpose instead.
