The retina (‘@2x’ or ‘@3x’) version of an image resource must be exactly double or triple the size of the corresponding low-resolution image (assuming the point size of the presentation context remains the same regardless of screen resolution). Otherwise the effective resolution of the image will not match the effective resolution of its presentation context, which will lead to a blurry image, empty space at the edges, or overflow.
